## Steps I took
- created folder structure and git repo
- created a new IAM user and added it to the AWS console
- chose a BTC API to get the current price of BTC (Coinbase)
- installed aws-sam-cli (serverless application model cli tool)
- created a new SAM project
- updated the template.yaml file to create a new API Gateway endpoint, define a new DynamoDB table, and define a new Lambda function
- created the actual lambda function to get the BTC price
- build the application with SAM build
- deployed the stack for the first time with SAM deploy --guided
  - curling GET https://d1d64qf74g.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/price  returns the current price of BTC
- created lambda function to submit a guess
- updated template.yaml to add a new API Gateway endpoint for the submit guess function and also return that as an output after successful deploy
- build and deployed the stack
  - curling POST with player id and guess https://d1d64qf74g.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/guess works correctly
