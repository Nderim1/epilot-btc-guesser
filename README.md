## Steps I took
- Initialize codebase
  - created folder structure and git repo
- Configure AWS
  - created a new IAM user and added it to the AWS console
  - chose a BTC API to get the current price of BTC (Coinbase)
  - installed aws-sam-cli (serverless application model cli tool)
  - Created a new SAM project
  - updated the template.yaml file to create a new API Gateway endpoint and define a new DynamoDB table
- Implement Lambda functions
  - Get BTC price Lambda function
    - created the lambda function to get the BTC price
    - build and deployed the app with SAM for the first time using SAM build and SAM deploy --guided
    - curling GET https://d1d64qf74g.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/price to make sure it returns the current price of BTC
  - Submit guess Lambda function
    - created the lambda function to submit a guess by passing player id and guess
    - build and deployed the app with SAM
    - curling POST with player id and guess https://d1d64qf74g.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/guess works correctly
  - Get Status Lambda function
    - created the lambda function to get the status of the user (active guesses and current score)
    - build and deployed the app with SAM
    - curling GET https://d1d64qf74g.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/status to make sure it returns the current status of the game
- Implement frontend
  - created a new React and Typescript project with Vite
  - installed additional libraries: Tanstack query, chart.js, heroicons and Tailwind CSS
  - had to enable CORS in the API Gateway console to remove the CORS error
