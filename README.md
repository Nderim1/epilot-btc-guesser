## Steps I took
- created folder structure and git repo
- created a new IAM user and added it to the AWS console
- chose a BTC API to get the current price of BTC (Coinbase)
- installed aws-sam-cli (serverless application model cli tool)
- created a new SAM project
- updated the template.yaml file to create a new API Gateway endpoint, define a new DynamoDB table, and define a new Lambda function
